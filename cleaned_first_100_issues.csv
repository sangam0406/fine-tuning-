The section for storage calculations seems incorrect. 

Each Query (50Bytes) would have a list of results with a title (20 Bytes) and a snippet (200 Bytes). The readme says then that each query will have a cache size of 270 Bytes. 

This is only true if each query returns 1 result. In reality most queries would return multiple results (a result defined as a a title and snippet). Therefore it would make sense to limit the number of related documents stored from a query to a set amount (example 200 documents so 270 Bytes * 200 = 54 000 Bytes or 54 KB per query).

I think it would be better to emphasize that the user's data distribution may be uneven when the user's geographic location is used to shard the table. For example, the users are mainly concentrated in a certain area, the data will mainly in a single shard. Sometime this situation will make a big trouble. 
Therefore, I think it should be emphasized —— Find a better way to shard table and to avoid the situation mentioned above.

Feature request: Improve readability by moving the contents into a site,"[{""name:"": ""needs-review"", ""description:"": ""none"", ""color"": ""5319e7""}]","First of all, a huge thanks to @donnemartin . This repository is the source of truth to all the resources of the system design and you have shown your great effort to maintain this masterpiece.

I truly follow the resources and I believe it really helps others as well. But reading the resources on one page, sometimes make my work harder. I couldn't navigate properly, I have to scroll up and down to find a section and sometimes I lost to keep track of the content as everything on one page. During this hardship, I am thinking of some ideas where we can improve the readability and introduce smooth navigation.

- [ ] We can split the contents into multiple markdowns instead of one single file.
- [ ] We can convert the entire content into a doc site which also improves the navigation.

Thinking of that, I made a prototype to get it started. I created a repo to split all the contents and convert them into a static site using [gatsbyjs.](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

Here is my repository.

Latency numbers: remove conversion to throughput,"[{""name:"": ""needs-review"", ""description:"": ""none"", ""color"": ""5319e7""}]","Remove conversion of latency numbers to throughput.

This is misleading for two reasons:
1. Latency and throughput are not computable from each other. For example: if I know it takes 1 second to turn on the hose, get 1 liter of water, and turn it off, I cannot conclude that the maximum rate I can get water out of the hose is 1 liter per second (though I can conclude it's more than that). 
2. The throughput estimates seem suspect, in and of themselves. These are great numbers to know, of course, but need to be backed by a separate source. (This'll be extra important if and when this guide includes information about, say, GPUs, which are optimized for throughput).",https://api.github.com/repos/donnemartin/system-design-primer/issues/427,https://api.github.com/repos/donnemartin/system-design-primer,en

Reverse index vs. inverted index,"[{""name:"": ""needs-review"", ""description:"": ""none"", ""color"": ""5319e7""}]","Hi!

[Design a key-value cache to save the results of the most recent web server queries](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/query_cache/README.md#design-a-key-value-cache-to-save-the-results-of-the-most-recent-web-server-queries) and [Design a web crawler](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/web_crawler/README.md) both are described as using a ""Reverse index service"". I believe this should be an _inverted_ index. Reversing the index simply reverses the key, e.g. `123` becomes `321` and speeds up inserts (at the expense of slowing down range queries.) [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_index), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19882785/what-is-the-point-of-reverse-indexing).

Is there a trade-off between performance and scalability?,"[{""name:"": ""needs-review"", ""description:"": ""none"", ""color"": ""5319e7""}]","https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#performance-vs-scalability

Does a system have to sacrifice performance for scalability?
Even if I read the sources, I still can't get it.
Why is there a trade-off between them?

Question about `Redis is useful as a simple message broker but messages can be lost.`,"[{""name:"": ""needs-review"", ""description:"": ""none"", ""color"": ""5319e7""}]","I have no question about redis is worse than professional message broker like RabbitMQ.

But I have a doubt about redis will lose messages. I am not sure whether the author used redis as a message broker before. As per my past exp, redis won't lose messages neither restart the server nor fail to implement the messages.

At least, when I was using [sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) (behind is `redis`), no message lost ever happened by default configuration.
